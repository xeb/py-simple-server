# Kubernetes Config
This path is broken up into the following directories:

# Current path

# control
This is for general cluster control type of scripts

# ops
This is for day-to-day operational scripts we expect people to run and some samples of common operations to apply to a cluster

# setup
This is all about setting up the kubernetes cluster itself
